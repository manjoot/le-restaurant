# Le Restaurant - Manjoot Narwal

This is my synoptic project for end pojnt assessment of my apprenticeship, a restaurant application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This app has been **successfully deployed** using **Vercel**, the link is: **https://le-restaurant-deployed.vercel.app/**

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Setup

Firstly  begin by unzipping the 'le-restaurant' folder within the project folder - this is the application itself.

Once unzipped, open the terminal in the 'le-restaurant' directory, and install all the required dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) ðŸš€
